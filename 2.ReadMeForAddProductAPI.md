addProduct(req, res) {
    const{name,price,sizes} = req.body;
    const newProduct = {
      name,
      price: parseFloat(price),
      sizes: sizes.split(','),
      imageUrl: req.file.filename,
    }
  } What we are doing here

  
It looks like you are defining an addProduct function that handles a POST request containing product information, such as name, price, sizes, and an image file. Let's break down the code:

addProduct(req, res) {
  // Destructuring product information from the request body
  const { name, price, sizes } = req.body;

  // Creating a new product object with the extracted information
  const newProduct = {
    name,
    price: parseFloat(price), // Parsing the price as a float
    sizes: sizes.split(','),   // Splitting the sizes string into an array
    imageUrl: req.file.filename, // Getting the filename of the uploaded image from req.file
  }

  // Further logic to be added based on your application requirements
  // (e.g., storing the product in a database, sending a response to the client, etc.)
}

Here's what each part of the code does:

const { name, price, sizes } = req.body;: Destructures the relevant properties from the request body. This assumes that the request body contains properties like name, price, and sizes.

const newProduct = { ... };: Creates a new product object with the extracted information. It converts the price to a float using parseFloat and splits the sizes string into an array using the split method.

imageUrl: req.file.filename: Assumes that the product includes an image file, and it sets the imageUrl property to the filename of the uploaded image. This assumes that you are using a file upload middleware (such as Multer) to handle file uploads, and req.file contains information about the uploaded file.

Remember, this is a basic example, and you may need to add further logic based on your application's requirements. This might include validation, storing the product in a database, sending a response to the client, etc.
