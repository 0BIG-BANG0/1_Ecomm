In the typical request-response cycle of a RESTful
API, what is the correct flow?

--Client -> Server -> Route -> Controller -> Model -> Controller -> Client 

Explanation--In a RESTful API, the flow of a request starts from the client to the server. The server then
directs the request to the appropriate route. The route invokes the appropriate controller
function, which may interact with the model to fetch or manipulate data. The controller then
sends a response back to the client.

Understanding the post req

For that we have to add body-parser 

>>npm i -body-parser 
--app.use(bodyParser.json())

Fixing Issues in Windows in Upload File

Invalid Characters in Windows Filenames:
It's important to note that Windows has a set of characters that are considered
invalid for filenames. These characters include:
● < (less than)
● > (greater than)
● : (colon)
● " (double quote)
● / (forward slash)
● \ (backslash)
● | (vertical bar or pipe)
● ? (question mark)
● * (asterisk)
These characters are not allowed in Windows filenames and can cause issues when
files are created or accessed on Windows-based systems


Modification for Windows Filename Compatibility:
To resolve the issue of colons in filenames for Windows compatibility, the code can
be updated as follows:
filename: (req, file, cb) => {
cb(
null,
new Date().toISOString().replace(/:/g, '_') +
file.originalname
);

In the updated code, the String.prototype.replace() method is used to replace
all colons in the timestamp with underscores. This modification ensures that the
generated filename is unique and does not contain any illegal characters, making it
compatible with Windows and other operating systems.

Conclusion:
● By addressing the issue of colons in filenames using the updated code, we
ensure cross-platform compatibility for file uploads.
● Windows users, in particular, will no longer face problems when working with
filenames generated by this code, making the application more user-friendly
and accessible across different operating systems.

HTTP Status Code

As per the HTTP/1.1 specification, a POST request that results in the creation of a new resource should respond with a 201 (Created)
status code. It is also a common practice to include the newly created resource in the response to confirm its creation and to provide the
client with the new resource's details, including any server-generated fields like its ID.
