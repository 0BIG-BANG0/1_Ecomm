JWT 
JWT (JSON Web Token) in a client-server architecture offers
stateless authentication, eliminating session storage for scalability. It
enables interoperability, allowing web clients and mobile apps to
understand and use tokens. JWT securely carries authentication and
authorization info, reducing server lookups for improved
performance. It's a valuable tool for secure and scalable
authentication in client-server setups.


JWT Payload Security

The JWT payload can be read without the secret key as it is base64-
encoded, not encrypted. However, including sensitive information in
the payload is not recommended due to potential security issues if
the token is intercepted or compromised. JWT's main security relies
on its signature for data integrity and authenticity.
